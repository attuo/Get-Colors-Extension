# Get-Colors-Extension (Work in progress)

Browser extension for getting website colors easily.

### ✨ [Demo]()

## 🤓 Motivation

Every now and then I have a need for using same colors than on some website. Usually I do it by inspecting website with the developer tools. The problem is that it is quite slow. For this problem I created this little extension to get all the website's colors fast.

## 🛠️ Technical details

Done
- [X] Working Firefox Web Extension that fetches website's colors
- [X] All done with HTML/CSS/JS, because why not!
- [X] No libraries nor any dependencies

Still work in progress
