## 🤓 Motivation

Every now and then I have a need for using the color codes from some website that I think has nice looking color scheme. The problem is that the HEX value copy pasting from browser's developer tools is kinda tedious and that is why I built this handy little browser extension to fix that problem.

And as a extra challenge for myself I wanted to make it simple as possible, with good old HTML/CSS/JS stack without any dependencies.

## 🛠️ Technical details

Done
- [X] Working browser extension that presents website colors on popup window
- [X] Super simple and easy to use
- [X] All done with HTML/CSS/JS, because why not!
- [X] No libraries nor any dependencies

Work in progress

- [ ] Publish to Chrome and Edge
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Grouping colors by HTML elements
